            Helpful Tips:
            - To find the blog articles names and URLs, perform searches on Google such as the following:
                -"{company} [POSITION HERE] blog articles"
            - To find the youtube interviews, perform searches on Youtube such as the following:
                -"{company} [POSITION HERE] interview"
                
            Important:
            - Once you have found the information, immediately stop searching for additional information.
            - Only return the requested information. Nothing else!
            - Do not generate fake information. Oly the information you find. Nothing else!
            - Do not stop researching until you find the requested information for each position in the company.
